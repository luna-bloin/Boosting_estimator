# Boosting_estimator
Code repository for the calculation and evaluation of return periods for extreme events generated through Ensemble boosting

## Preprocessing
The code provided under 'code/preprocess' preprocesses the data to get TXx5d averaged over the PNW region as explained in the paper. However, this code is not directly reproducible, since it relies on hard-coded paths to data sets (some of which are not publicly available). However, in the interest of transparency, they are still accessible, and the preprocessed data necessary for the plots can be found here:
